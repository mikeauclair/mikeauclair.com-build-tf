ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Mike Auclair, a software engineer living in Chicago, IL. I recently wrapped up my stint as Engineering Director at [Ad Hoc](https://adhoc.team). During my time there, I spent some time building front-end and back-end applications, designing the architecture for (and taking part in the implementation of) the new plan shopping experience on [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov), building out teams to take on new and existing work on healthcare.gov, staffing teams for new work across the company, and mentoring our corps of engineering leads.

Things I care about deeply include:
- Building teams that feel ownership of the applications they build
- Using measurement to drive change in systems, but recognizing that it will never tell you if you're not building the right thing for your users
- Mentoring engineers and those directly leading them, both technically and career-wise
- Recognizing that the technological system is only one part of the wider system it operates in
- Scaling systems and teams through simplicity
